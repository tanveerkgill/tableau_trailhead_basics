## Reflection

One of the most essential Data Storytelling principles I learned was to keep the message simple and intentional, which prompted me to develop a viz that clearly displays how viewership patterns differ by network and how themes vary in popularity.  Using a stacked bar chart for categorized performance and a line chart for trends over time, I concentrated on choosing visualizations that make comparisons easy to understand.  From the Tableau Data Model classes, the primary idea that stood out was the importance of connections instead than joins, because relationships preserve the original level of detail and prevent duplicating or inflating data when working across several tables. This concerns in real-world datasets as tables often have varying granularity, such as Episodes, Bakers, and Outcomes in the GBBO dataset. By linking distinct tables for visits, lab results, and diagnoses without skewing the data, this method might be useful for monitoring patient outcomes in a healthcare setting.  Tableau is a perfect fit for this because it can integrate complicated data structures while still offering clear, visual storytelling that helps speedy decision-making.
